# 🌑 VEILED REALM CHRONICLES

### **I wrote a trilogy. I built this website. Now, I want you to read it.**

Welcome to the official repository for **Veiled Realm**, my dark fantasy trilogy about the shattering of memory and the rise of the Shadow.

I built this interactive experience using **React & Tailwind** to bring the world of the books to life—but the *real* story isn't in the code. It's in the pages.

**If you like dark magic, ancient mysteries, and heroes breaking under the weight of the void, this series is for you.**
